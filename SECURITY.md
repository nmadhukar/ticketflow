# TicketFlow Security Audit & Zero-Trust Implementation

## Executive Summary

TicketFlow implements a comprehensive zero-trust security architecture where no component, user, or request is trusted by default. This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and compliance standards implemented throughout the application.

## Zero-Trust Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users only have access to resources they need
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Assume Breach**: Design assumes attackers are already inside the network
5. **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points

### Implementation

#### 1. Authentication Layer

**Multi-Factor Authentication Options:**
- Primary: Email/Password with bcrypt hashing (10 salt rounds)
- Secondary: Microsoft 365 SSO with OAuth 2.0
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies

**Password Security:**
```typescript
// Password hashing implementation
const saltRounds = 10;
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);

// Password requirements enforced:
- Minimum 8 characters
- No maximum length restriction
- Complexity not enforced (per NIST guidelines)
- Password history not stored
```

**Session Management:**
- Sessions stored in PostgreSQL (not in memory)
- 7-day expiration with sliding window
- Secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies
- CSRF protection via session tokens

#### 2. Authorization Layer

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
```typescript
Roles:
- Admin: Full system access
- Manager: Department management, reports
- User: Standard ticket operations
- Customer: Limited to own tickets only

// Authorization middleware example
const requireAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user?.role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Admin access required' });
  }
  next();
};
```

**Resource-Level Permissions:**
- Tickets: Users can only edit assigned/created tickets
- Teams: Only team admins can manage members
- Departments: Only managers can view department data
- API Keys: Admin-only access with encryption

#### 3. Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest:**
- Database: PostgreSQL with encryption enabled
- File Storage: Encrypted blob storage
- API Keys: Encrypted before database storage
- Sensitive fields: Additional application-level encryption

**Encryption in Transit:**
- HTTPS enforced in production
- TLS 1.2+ required
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

**Data Minimization:**
- Only collect necessary user data
- Automatic data purging policies
- No sensitive data in logs
- Redacted API responses

#### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Zod Schema Validation:**
```typescript
// Example validation schema
const createTicketSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(200),
  description: z.string().max(5000),
  priority: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent']),
  // SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
});
```

**XSS Prevention:**
- React's automatic escaping
- Content Security Policy headers
- Sanitization of user-generated content
- No inline scripts or styles

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
- Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
- No raw SQL execution
- Input validation before database operations
- Prepared statements only

#### 5. API Security

**Rate Limiting:**
```typescript
// Rate limit configuration
Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/minute/IP
API endpoints: 100 requests/minute/user
File uploads: 10 requests/minute/user
```

**API Key Management:**
- Separate keys for different services (SES, Bedrock)
- Keys never exposed to frontend
- Rotation reminders and expiration
- Audit logging for key usage

**CORS Configuration:**
```typescript
cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(','),
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
})
```

#### 6. Audit & Monitoring

**Comprehensive Logging:**
- All authentication attempts
- Permission denied events
- Data modifications with before/after
- API key usage
- File access attempts

**Security Events Tracked:**
```typescript
- Failed login attempts
- Password reset requests
- Role changes
- Privilege escalations
- Suspicious activity patterns
```

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Alert on multiple failed login attempts
- Geographic access monitoring
- Automated threat response

#### 7. Infrastructure Security

**Environment Variables:**
- No secrets in code repository
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure secret management
- Regular rotation policies

**Dependency Management:**
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance
- Supply chain security

**Container Security:**
- Minimal base images
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only file systems where possible
- Network segmentation

## Security Best Practices

### Development Security

1. **Secure Coding Standards:**
   - Code reviews required for all changes
   - Security linting with ESLint security plugins
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

2. **Secret Management:**
   - Never commit secrets
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement secret rotation
   - Audit secret access

3. **Testing Security:**
   - Security-focused unit tests
   - Integration tests for auth flows
   - Penetration testing schedule
   - Vulnerability assessments

### Operational Security

1. **Incident Response Plan:**
   - 24-hour response SLA
   - Defined escalation procedures
   - Post-incident reviews
   - Security patch timeline

2. **Access Control:**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews
   - Automated deprovisioning
   - Multi-factor for admin access

3. **Backup & Recovery:**
   - Encrypted backups
   - Regular restore testing
   - Offsite backup storage
   - Disaster recovery plan

## Compliance & Standards

### Standards Compliance
